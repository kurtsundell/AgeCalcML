### Run with MATLAB
To run AgeCalcML in MATLAB open the AgeCalcML.m file and run the file directly from the code. 

### Run without MATLAB
AgeCalcML can be run in MATLAB or as a standalone .exe file (Windows) or .app file (macOS) that can be used without having a copy MATLAB. The file can be run from your computer's Desktop, or wherever you choose to keep it. 

Here's a video link that explains how to download and run AgeCalcML: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP-ADh8wvk4

Here is the link to the AgeCalcML standalone graphical user interface (GUIs) latest releases and EXAMPLE DATA SETS:

https://github.com/kurtsundell/AgeCalcML/releases

The GUIs require installation of the free MATLAB Runtime. GUI releases 1.30 to present require MATLAB Runtime Compiler 2018b version 9.5. There are separate compilers for macOS and Windows. Install the compiler first, then run the .exe (Windows) or .app (macOS).

Here are the links for the compilers (click to start download). Follow all of the default settings to install. Nothing will happen following installation -- there is no need to open the compiler -- AgeCalcML will access it automatically.
